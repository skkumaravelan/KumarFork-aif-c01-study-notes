- **Key Concept**: AI with a broad ability to perform multiple tasks across domains, unlike specialized AI systems.
- **Examples**: **Expert Systems**, **Rules Engines** (e.g., MYCIN), which use predefined logic and rules to make decisions.

### Machine Learning (ML)
- **Definition**: A subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming or rules.
- **Key Concept**: AI that operates through data patterns and training, rather than explicitly coded instructions.
- **Examples**: **Linear Regression**, **Decision Trees**, **Support Vector Machines**—supervised learning algorithms used for predictive tasks.

### Deep Learning
- **Definition**: A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to model complex patterns in data.
- **Key Concept**: Effective for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous systems.
- **Examples**: **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image processing, **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** for sequential data like time-series or language models.

### Generative AI
- **Definition**: A subset of deep learning focused on creating new content (such as text, images, or music) from learned data. Generative AI models are generally based on **foundation models**, which are large, pre-trained models that can be adapted to a wide range of tasks.
- **Key Concept**: AI systems that generate novel outputs based on patterns learned during training. Foundation models provide the versatility needed for fine-tuning on specific tasks.
- **Examples**: **ChatGPT** for text generation, **DALL·E** for image generation, **DeepDream** for artistic visual generation.

## Concepts

### In-Context Learning
- **Definition**: A method of enhancing generative AI models by adding additional data and examples to the prompt, helping the model solve tasks more effectively.

### Prompt Types
- **Few-Shot Prompt**: Providing a few examples in the prompt to guide the model’s behavior.
- **Zero-Shot Prompt**: Providing no examples in the prompt, asking the model to perform the task without guidance.
- **One-Shot Prompt**: Providing exactly one example to guide the model’s behavior.
- **Prompt Template**: A pre-defined format or structure for prompts to standardize and improve the interaction with AI models.
- **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: A method where the prompt encourages the model to break down reasoning into steps.
- **Prompt Tuning**: The process of adjusting prompts to improve model performance for specific tasks.

### Latent Space
- **Definition**: The encoded knowledge or patterns captured by large language models (LLMs) that store relationships between data.
- **Usage**: It represents the internal understanding of language or data that AI models use to generate outputs.

### Embeddings
- **Definition**: Numerical, vectorized representations of tokens (words, phrases, etc.) that capture their semantic meaning.
- **Use Case**: Used for tasks like semantic search, where the meaning of a word or token is important.
- **Storage**: Can be stored in a vector database for efficient search and retrieval.

### Tokens
- **Definition**: The basic units of text (e.g., words, subwords, or characters) that are processed by language models. In the context of LLMs, tokens are used to represent both inputs (text provided) and outputs (text generated).

### Context-Window
- **Definition**: The maximum amount of tokens an LLM model can process at once, including both the input prompt and the output generated by the model. If the number of tokens exceeds the model’s context-window, earlier parts of the text may be truncated.
- **Usage**: The context-window is a key factor in determining how much information can be fed into the model at one time and affects tasks like long-form text generation, document analysis, or multi-turn conversations.

### Hallucinations
- **Definition**: Hallucinations occur when a language model generates incorrect or nonsensical information that may sound plausible but is not grounded in factual data or the provided input.
- **Mitigations**: 
  - Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): Mitigates hallucinations by retrieving relevant external data during the generation process, ensuring the model generates responses based on accurate information.
  - Fine-Tuning: Training the model on more relevant, accurate data can help reduce hallucinations by aligning the model’s output with factual knowledge.
  - Human-in-the-Loop (HITL): Incorporating human review in low-confidence areas can prevent hallucinated outputs from being used in critical applications.

---

### Search Methods
- **Keyword Search**: Matches exact terms in the search query.
- **Semantic Search**: Uses embeddings to understand the meaning behind the search query, allowing for more accurate and meaningful results.

---

### 6. Train, Tune, and Evaluate the Model
- **Description**: Train the model, tune it, and evaluate performance.
- **Key Activities**:
  - Train the model iteratively and fine-tune parameters.
  - Tune hyperparameters (e.g., epoch, batch size, learning rate) and run experiments.
  - Evaluate the model using metrics and compare performance.

- **Parameters**:
  - **Inference Parameters** (supported by Amazon Bedrock):
    - **Randomness and Diversity**:
      - Temperature:
        - Controls randomness—higher values lead to more diverse, creative outputs; lower values produce more predictable, deterministic results.
      - Top K:
        - Limits the model to selecting from the top K most probable tokens; smaller K values result in safer, more predictable choices.
        - Top K is not a terribly useful parameter - use Temperature or Top-P instead. 
      - Top P:
        - Uses cumulative probability to choose tokens, focusing on the smallest set of tokens with a combined probability of P, balancing randomness and diversity.
        - Higher Top P values (closer to 1) reduce randomness by restricting the token pool to only the most probable choices. 
      - Top-K vs Top-P: Top K fixes the number of tokens considered, while Top P uses a variable number of tokens based on their combined probability, making Top P more adaptive and flexible in balancing randomness.
      - Temperature vs. Top P: Temperature adjusts the overall randomness by scaling probabilities, allowing more or less randomness across all possible tokens. Top P narrows the token choices to those that collectively add up to a certain probability threshold, balancing randomness with accuracy.
      - Use Cases:
        - Use Top-P when you want adaptive diversity but want to stay closer to more likely outcomes.
        - Use Temperature when you need consistent randomness control across the board.  
    - Response length:
      - Specifies the maximum length of generated output, affecting how verbose or concise the response is.
    - Penalties:
      - Applies penalties to repeated tokens or sequences to encourage variety in the generated text.
    - Stop sequences:
      - Defines specific sequences where the model will stop generating text, ensuring controlled output length or format.
  - **Model Training Parameters** (Hyperparameters):
    - **Epoch**: The number of iterations through the entire dataset.
      - Increasing epochs generally improves the model's learning but can lead to overfitting if too high. More epochs help the model learn better but might also result in diminishing returns after a certain point.
    - **Batch Size**: Number of samples before updating model parameters.
      - Smaller batch sizes provide more frequent updates, which can help in converging quickly but can introduce more noise. Larger batch sizes are more stable but may require more computation and memory.
    - **Learning Rate**: Controls how fast the model learns.
      - A high learning rate speeds up training but may skip optimal solutions, while a low learning rate leads to slower but more precise convergence, though it risks getting stuck in local minima.

- **Error Metrics**:
  - MSE (Mean Squared Error): During model evaluation, MSE is often used to measure how well the model is performing. It calculates the average squared difference between predicted values and actual values, giving more weight to larger errors. A lower MSE indicates better performance, making it useful for comparing different models or tuning hyperparameters.
  - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): RMSE is the square root of MSE and gives an error measure in the same unit as the predicted values, making it more interpretable. RMSE is also used during evaluation to see how much error is expected per prediction. Like MSE, lower RMSE values signal better model performance.
   
- **Model Training Issues**:
  - **Overfitting**: Too much training on the same data, causing the model to be overly specific.
    - Solution: Use more diverse data during training.
  - **Underfitting**: The model doesn’t learn enough patterns from the data.
    - Solution: Train the model for more epochs or with more data.
  - **Bias and Fairness**: Lack of diversity in training data leading to biased predictions.
    - Solution: Ensure diverse and representative training data; include fairness constraints.

- **Fine-Tuning** (BedRock and SageMaker):
  - Adjust the weights of a pre-trained model with your specific and _labelled_ data to adapt it for new tasks. 
  - Be aware that if you only provide instructions for a single task, the model may lose its more general purpose capability and experience _catastrophic forgetting_.
  - **Domain adaptation fine-tuning** (SageMaker): Tailors a pre-trained foundation model to a specific domain (e.g., legal, medical) using a small amount of domain-specific data. This helps the model perform better on tasks related to that particular domain.
  - **Instruction-based fine-tuning** (SageMaker): Involves providing labeled examples of specific tasks (e.g., summarization, classification) to improve a model’s performance on that particular task. This type of fine-tuning is useful for making the model better at tasks where precise outputs are needed.
 
- **Continued-Pretraining** (BedRock):
  - Using _unlabeled_ data to expand the model's overall knowledge without narrowing its scope to a specific task.
     
- **Tools**:
  - **SageMaker Training Jobs**: Manage training processes, specify training data, hyperparameters, and compute resources.
  - **SageMaker Experiments**: Track model runs and hyperparameter tuning.
  - **Automatic Model Tuning (AMT)**: Automatically tune hyperparameters using the specified metric.

### Confusion Matrix Evaluation Metrics

| **Metric**             | **Description**                                                                                                                     |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Accuracy**            | Measures overall correctness — the proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives). Higher is better.           |
| **Precision**           | Focuses on minimizing false positives (e.g., spam detection). Higher is better.                                                    |
| **Recall (TPR)**        | Focuses on minimizing false negatives (e.g., disease screenings). Higher is better.                                                |
| **F1 Score**            | Balances precision and recall, useful when both false positives and false negatives matter (e.g., document classification).         |
| **False Positive Rate** | Measures incorrect positive predictions (e.g., security alarms). Lower is better.                                                  |
| **Specificity (TNR)**   | Maximizes true negatives, crucial for tests that identify non-diseased patients. Higher is better.                                  |
